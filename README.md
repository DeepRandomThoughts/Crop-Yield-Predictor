# Crop-Yield-Predictor
Problem Statement

India is primarily an agricultural country with a majority of the population working in agricultural fields. Approximately 70% of the country's GDP is through agriculture.
The Indian Agricultural Department monitors crop yields for different districts, for different crops every year.
The yield for districts is dependent on various factors like rainfall, precipitation, relative humidity, temperature, wind speed, etc.
In this challenge, we ask you to analyse the given weather and agricultural data. Specifically, we ask you to use your knowledge of data science to predict the yield of a given crop in a given district for a given year.

Data Description

In the following dataset, you have been provided with the data relating to the agricultural yield for different crops in different districts spanning across multiple years.

Deliverables

• ‘prediction.csv’ having two columns, ‘ID’ and ‘Yield’ for all the records in test.csv
• Jupyter notebook/ Python script of the approach used to solve the problem.
